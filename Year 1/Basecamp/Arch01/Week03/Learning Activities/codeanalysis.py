    # Code 1
    # I think code 1 will print the numbers from 1 to 7 
    # plus 7 again so until 14

    # i = 7
    # for number in range(1, i + i):
    #    print(number)

    # Code 2
    # It will print the numbers from 1 to 5
    # After it will print Hello 5 times

    # i = 1
    # j = 10
    # for number in range(i, j):
    #    if number > 5:
    #        print(number)
    #    else:
    #        print('Hello')

    # Code 3
    # It will calculate how many spaces there
    # And also how many times "a" appears
    # It will do " " - "a" basically

    # sentence = "I just came to say hello!"
    # count = 0
    # for letter in sentence:
    #    if letter == " ":
    #        count = count + 1
    #    elif letter == "a":
    #        count = count - 1
    # print(count)

    # Code 4
    # It will print the sentence vertically

    # sentence = "I just came to say hello!"
    # for i in range(0, len(sentence)):
    # 	print(sentence[i])

    # Code 5
    # It's the same as in code 4
    # sentence = "I just came to say hello!"
    # for c in sentence:
    # 	print(c)
